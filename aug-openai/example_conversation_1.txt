[doctor] anything like that w- ... okay . all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , all right ? hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office , your vital signs look good . you do n't have a fever , which is good .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] your heart rate and your , uh , blood pressure look fine . i'm just gon na check some things out , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right . does that hurt ?
[patient] a little bit . that's tender .
[doctor] okay , so on physical examination , on your heart exam , i do appreciate a little two out of six systolic ejection murmur-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . which we've heard in the past . okay , so that seems stable . on your knee exam , there is some edema and some erythema of your right knee , but your left knee looks fine , okay ? um , you do have some pain to palpation of the right knee and some decreased range of motion , um , on exam , okay ? so what does that mean ? so we'll go ahead and we'll see if we can take a look at some of these things . i know that they did an x-ray before you came in , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so let's take a look at that .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . so here's the r- here's your right knee x-ray . this basically shows that there's good bony alignment . there's no acute fracture , which is not surprising , based on the history .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay ? hey , dragon , show me the labs . and here , looking at your lab results , you know , your white blood cell count is not elevated , which is good . you know , we get concerned about that in somebody who's immunocompromised .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and it looks like your kidney function is also very good . so i'm , i'm very happy about that .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay ? so i just wan na go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so for your knee pain , i think that this is an acute exacerbation of your arthritis , okay ? so i wan na go ahead and if ... and prescribe some ultram 50 milligrams every six hours as needed .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay ? i also wan na go ahead and just order an autoimmune panel , okay ? hey , dragon , order an autoimmune panel . and you know , i , i want , i want you to just take it easy for right now , and if your symptoms continue , we'll talk about further imaging and possibly referral to physical therapy , okay ?
[patient] you got it .
[doctor] for your second problem , your hypothyroidism , i wan na go ahead and continue you on this ... on the synthroid , and i wan na go ahead and order some thyroid labs , okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order a thyroid panel . and then for your last problem , the arthritis , you know , we just kinda talked about that . you know , it's gon na be a struggle for you because again , you ca n't take some of those anti-inflammatory medications because of your kidney transplant , so ...
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] you know , let's see how we do over the next couple weeks , and again , we'll refer you to physical therapy if we need to , okay ?
[patient] you got it .
[doctor] you have any questions ?
